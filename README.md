# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Austin :man_technologist:	
### I work in cyber security but have been coding my whole life. Here's the one-stop shop for all scripts and side projects I've created. 
#### If you want to reach out to me, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kodebrobaggins). Just know, not everything I tweet about is tech related.

The main project I'm maintaining is aia, a python script that takes a list of URLs and returns whether or not you can connect to them. Basic in principle, but necessary in practice.
